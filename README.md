# 📝 To-Do List App

A sleek and modern **To-Do List** application built with **Vue 3**, focused on simplicity, performance, and extensibility. At its core, the app supports full **CRUD** operations — with an evolving enhancement to transform it into a **Kanban-style task board** with **drag-and-drop** functionality.
